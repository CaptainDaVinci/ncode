# Solution

* First things first, lets store Bassanio's location and Portio's location into variables  $(s_i,s_j)$ and $(e_i,e_j)$ which accepting the inputs itself.
* Now let's keep a $dist[][]$ array, to keep track of the shortest dist to each cell from Bassanio's cell. 
* Let's assume that initially, all cell are inaccessible from Bassanio's cell so all values in $dist[][]$ is initialized to $\infty$ except Bassanio's and Portia's cells.
* After this perform a [Dijkstra's](https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/dijkstra.html) using Bassanio's cells as the source.

* Time Complexity : $O(n^2+m)$
